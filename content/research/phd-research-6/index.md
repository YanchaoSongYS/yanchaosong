**Highlights**
- The i-DREAMS interventions significantly reduce kinematic driving risk and traffic offense risk.
- The effectiveness of real-time and post-trip interventions exhibits cross-national differences.
- A strong negative association exists between adherence to real-time interventions and individual driving risk.
- A strong positive association exists between engagement with post-trip interventions and adherence scores in kinematic driving.
- Gamification elements promote adherence to real-time interventions, significantly reducing kinematic driving risk.
