**Highlights**
- In this study, a set of risk indicators of road users and roadways were developed based on their prior violation and crash records.
- Bayesian network was employed to explicitly explore statistical associations between crash severity and significant variables.
- Results indicated that the prior crash/violation experiences of road users and roadways were very important risk indicators.
- Results showed that certain variable combinations had enhanced impacts on severity outcome than single variables.
