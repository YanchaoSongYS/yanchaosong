**Highlights**
- Driving simulator data can be sampled in function of distance or time.
- Nearest sampled parameter value is a good proxy for the value at a point.
- Speed variations in zones result in mean speed underestimations based on raw data.
- Interpolated data are more suitable for the analysis of driving parameters in zones.
- Describing data processing approach is important in driving simulator research.
