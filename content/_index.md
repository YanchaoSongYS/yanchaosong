      title: '📚 My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My doctoral project established a comprehensive research framework for investigating risky driving behavior.
        
        I first developed an innovative method for assessing individual driving risk based on naturalistic driving data.
        
        Building on this foundation, I conducted an in-depth cross-national analysis of the effectiveness of both real-time and post-trip interventions, identifying key differences and their underlying causes across countries.
        
        I further integrated real-time intervention adherence and post-trip intervention engagement to model the working mechanisms of the i-DREAMS intervention technology, while also examining how demographic and psychological characteristics influence intervention engagement and adherence.
        
        Ultimately, my research aims to improve road safety by employing advanced machine learning techniques to enable real-time prediction of risky driving events and facilitate timely risk mitigation.
