      - **The Research of Multidimensional Association Rule in Traffic Accidents (_Team Member_)**
        - Collected the traffic accident data from Kunshan Traffic Police Department, on which build the multidimensional association rule model of traffic accidents.
        - Developed the analysis system of association factors in traffic accidents, which could mine the conditional factors of traffic accidents.
        - Present corresponding preventive measures to reduce the traffic accidents based on research findings.
      - **Predicting Future Driving Risk of Crash-Involved Drivers (_Team Leader_)**
        - Led a team to design the whole machine learning framework of driving risk predict model.
        - Defined driving risk based on prior violation and crash records of drivers.
        - Applied a feature selection procedure based on the random forest technique to extract significant risky driving factors.
        - Developed a reliable and explicable machine learning model to predict the future driving risk of crash- involved drivers.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
