      - **Accident Cause Modeling based on Machine Learning Techniques (_Team Leader_)**
        - This research project was supported by Open Project of Key Laboratory of Ministry of Public Security for Road Traffic Safety (No. 2018ZDSYSKFKT12).
        - Led a team to design a systematic machine learning framework of accident cause model.
        - Proposed a combined method of a locally linear embedding method and an improved K-means algorithm to identify the relationship between driver behaviors and crashes involvement.
        - Developed some risk indicators of drivers and roadways based on prior violation and crash records, which could reflect certain aspects and degree of crash risk.
        - Proposed a hybrid approach to integrate a variable selection procedure based on information value and a Bayesian network to quantitatively and graphically analyze crash severity patterns.
        - Applied a time series forecasting model based on neural networks to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of dangerous driver behaviors.
        - Conducted a project report and defense on behalf of the team.
      - **Setting Speed Limits of Urban Road Network in Ningbo Hangzhou Bay New Area (_Team Leader_)**
        - Led a team to design a safe systems approach to setting the speed limit.
        - Led a team to investigate potential safety hazards of road network in study area.
        - Conducted accident density analyses based on kernel density method and line density method in ArcGIS.
        - Determined adjustment factors for determining the proposed posted speed limit through regression modeling, considering the major physical features of the road and accident data.
        - Proposed a set of recommended speed limits of road network in Ningbo Hangzhou Bay New Area.
        - Conducted a project report and defense on behalf of the team.

    summary: |
      - **The Research of Multidimensional Association Rule in Traffic Accidents (_Team Member_)**
        - Collected the traffic accident data from Kunshan Traffic Police Department, on which build the multidimensional association rule model of traffic accidents.
        - Developed the analysis system of association factors in traffic accidents, which could mine the conditional factors of traffic accidents.
        - Present corresponding preventive measures to reduce the traffic accidents based on research findings.
      - **Predicting Future Driving Risk of Crash-Involved Drivers (_Team Leader_)**
        - Led a team to design the whole machine learning framework of driving risk predict model.
        - Defined driving risk based on prior violation and crash records of drivers.
        - Applied a feature selection procedure based on the random forest technique to extract significant risky driving factors.
        - Developed a reliable and explicable machine learning model to predict the future driving risk of crash- involved drivers.
